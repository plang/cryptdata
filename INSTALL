1. Generate an RSA keypair (with passphrase) with openssl:

openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.key 1024
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout > public.key

Don't forget to choose a passphrase when generating the private key.
This is the string you'll use for decoding your data.

Just like with any keypair, make sure it is secured correctly. For
example, set the owner to "root", and the group to the user your
web server is running under, most likely "www-data". 
Give "root" read-write access, "www-data" read-only access, and most 
important: not single right for "world".

Should look like this:

-rw-r-----  1 root     www-data  966 Dec  2 13:57 private.key
-rw-r-----  1 root     www-data  272 Dec  2 13:58 public.key

2. Install the plugin:

python setup.py bdist_egg
... then copy dist/*.egg file into your plugin folder.

3. Configure your RSA keypair in your trac.ini:

[cryptdata]
private_key_path = /the/path/of/your/private.key
public_key_path = /the/path/of/your/public.key

4. Reload your web server, and enjoy!

Type in any wiki page [[CPassword(my secret data)]], and save it.
